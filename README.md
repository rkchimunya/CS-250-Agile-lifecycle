## Reflection  

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do user stories help?  
I start with the user’s goals and pain points (interviews, surveys, or PO input), then translate them into **user stories** with clear acceptance criteria. The INVEST guideline keeps stories small and testable, while acceptance criteria and a shared Definition of Done connect user needs to testable behaviors. During backlog refinement, I break stories into tasks, estimate effort, and confirm dependencies. Short feedback loops—reviews, demos, and tester/PO collaboration—keep development aligned with user intent.  

### How do I approach developing programs? Which Agile practices will I carry forward?  
I prefer short, timeboxed sprints with a single prioritized backlog. I plan to keep:  
- **Scrum events** (Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retro) for cadence and improvement  
- **Backlog refinement** and **DoR/DoD** for clarity and quality  
- **Iterative delivery & demos** to validate value early  
- **Testing early and often** (unit + acceptance tests tied to user stories)  
- **Lightweight CI habits** (frequent commits and quick build checks)  

This approach helps me adapt quickly, reduce risk, and deliver valuable increments consistently.
